# Reactive-Bot-LiDAR-Based-Obstacle-Avoidance-in-MuJoCo
Project Objective: To implement a fundamental "reactive" navigation system for a mobile robot that autonomously avoids obstacles in real-time. 
Technical Stack: C++ for logic, MuJoCo for 3D physics simulation, and XML (MJCF) for robot modeling.
Description: This project focuses on "Sense-Act" behavior, using simulated range-finder sensors to guide a differential-drive robot through a cluttered 3D environment without a pre-generated map.
